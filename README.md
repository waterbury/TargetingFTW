12 o clock button is mode 1, 2 o clock is mode 2, etc
Select Difficulty - where applicable - Also uses the ring of buttons around the center button
12 o clock button is easy, next one is medium, next is hard
Future edits to the code may add harder and harder difficulties
Each game mode counts down from 3 before it starts
When game is over, all lights on the board flash 3 times
All lights are always randomly chosen and placed by the software, they will likely not be the same after each attempt.

This mode plays a sequence, user must repeat the sequence
Sequence adds one step each round
If user takes too long, they lose
Too long = more than 2 seconds?
